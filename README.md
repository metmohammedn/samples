# Code Samples for Meteorological Developer Interview

Thank you for the opportunity to interview for the Meteorological Developer secondment. This repository contains a few code samples I have prepared for your review, demonstrating my skills in machine learning, back-end and front-end web development, and my focus on creating practical, innovative solutions.

### 1. Python: Fine-Tuning a Transformer Model for Weather Forecasts

**File:** [`llm_finetuning.py`](./llm_finetuning.py)

This Python script demonstrates a complete pipeline for fine-tuning a T5-base Transformer model to generate weather forecasts. The goal is to automatically generate forecast text from input data. Note that the entire process for fine-tuning LLMs also require several other parts like data clean-up, tokenizing and for this project, pre-processing the data for tokenizing, however, for the purpose of the interview, I have only chosen the training block.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in **Python** for scientific machine learning and data pipelines.
* Experience developing and training sophisticated **Machine Learning models**.
* Expertise in handling large scientific datasets and working with tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* A passion for **automating forecasting processes** to deliver high-value meteorological solutions.

### 2. JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Plain Text to HTML Converter

**File:** [`html-converter`](./index.html) 

This is a practical front-end utility built to solve a real workflow problem for my team. It provides a simple web form that converts plain text with paragraphs and special characters into clean, correctly encoded HTML for use in another system.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in front-end web development using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.
* An understanding of modern JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and efficient string processing with regular expressions.
* My ability to identify a team's needs and build a tool to improve their efficiency.
* Strong knowledge of software development principles, including creating a good user interface and experience.

### 3. PHP: Dynamic Team Notice Board

**File:** [`notice-board`](./index.php)

This PHP script reads task information from a data source and dynamically generates a web-based notice board. The script includes business logic to highlight tasks that are due soon or are already completed. The refined code emphasizes security, efficiency, and modern PHP practices. Note that this is part of a whole where the entire project contains an entry form page, and an editable table for completed tasks or tasks that need to be updated. For the sake of demonstration, however, I have chosen the notice board display code only.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in back-end web development using **PHP**.
* Secure coding practices, specifically escaping all user-generated output with `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* The ability to design and develop software systems that support forecast operations.
* Data processing and applying conditional logic to create a clear and effective display for end-users.
