### 1. Python: Fine-Tuning a Transformer Model for Weather Forecasts

**File:** [`llm_finetuning.py`](./llm_finetuning.py)

This Python script demonstrates a complete pipeline for fine-tuning a T5-base Transformer model to generate weather forecasts. The goal is to automatically generate forecast text from input data.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in **Python** for scientific machine learning and data pipelines.
* Experience developing and training sophisticated **Machine Learning models**.
* Expertise in handling large scientific datasets and working in **Linux-based environments** with tools like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
* A passion for **automating forecasting processes** to deliver high-value meteorological solutions.

### 2. JavaScript/HTML/CSS: Plain Text to HTML Converter

**File:** [`html-converter/`](./PlainTextToHTML.html) 

This is a practical front-end utility built to solve a real workflow problem for my team. It provides a simple web form that converts plain text with paragraphs and special characters into clean, correctly encoded HTML for use in another system.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in front-end web development using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**.
* An understanding of modern JavaScript, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and efficient string processing with regular expressions.
* My ability to identify a team's needs and build a tool to improve their efficiency.
* Strong knowledge of software development principles, including creating a good user interface and experience.

### 3. PHP: Dynamic Team Notice Board

**File:** [`notice_board.php`](./notice_board.php)

This PHP script reads task information from a data source and dynamically generates a web-based notice board. The script includes business logic to highlight tasks that are due soon or are already completed. The refined code emphasizes security, efficiency, and modern PHP practices.

**This sample showcases:**
* Proficiency in back-end web development using **PHP**.
* Secure coding practices, specifically escaping all user-generated output with `htmlspecialchars()` to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
* The ability to design and develop software systems that support forecast operations.
* Data processing and applying conditional logic to create a clear and effective display for end-users.
